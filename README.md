# Chess_game with TKinter

This summer I wanted to make a quick and ez chess game using TKinter as the UI. This game took me around 2 days to make but I will improve it in the future and perhaps add my own chess bot.

Bugss:
- It is currently impossible to "castle"
- It is currently impossible to make the "en passant" move
- The check mate checker is not always accurate

Here is how the game looks:
